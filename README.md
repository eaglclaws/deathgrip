What is Deathgrip
-------------------------

Deathgrip is a Python script which is used to encrypt and decript plain text messages by converting letters to numbers and using a unique conversation salt.

Usage
-------------------------

As of now you can run the encoder (partial functionality) with a plain text file argument.

    encode.py -f input.txt
    
A list of command line arguments can be seen with 

	encode.py --help
    
The encoder will create a file called output.txt by default, if none are specified, with the encoded text in it.
